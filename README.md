🔧 Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bashCopygit clone https://github.com/ray-sdj/vulnerability-scanner.git
cd vulnerability-scanner
2. Install Dependencies
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install Nmap (System Dependency)
Ubuntu/Debian
bashCopysudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nmap
macOS (using Homebrew)
bashCopybrew install nmap
Windows
Download and install from Nmap Official Website
🚦 Usage
Basic Scanning
bashCopypython vulnerability_scanner.py
Example Scan
pythonCopyfrom vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

# Initialize scanner
target = "https://example.com"
scanner = VulnerabilityScanner(target)

# Perform comprehensive scan
results = scanner.comprehensive_scan()
print(results)
🔬 Scanning Modules
1. SSL Certificate Check

Validates SSL/TLS certificates
Checks expiration dates
Identifies potential certificate issues

2. Port Scanning

Discovers open ports
Identifies running services
Detects service versions

3. Domain Information

Retrieves WHOIS registration details
Checks DNS records
Provides domain history insights

4. Web Vulnerability Detection

Security header analysis
Basic XSS vulnerability testing
Preliminary SQL injection probing

⚠️ Ethical Usage Warning
🚨 IMPORTANT:

Only scan websites/networks you own or have explicit permission to test
Unauthorized scanning may be illegal
Respect privacy and legal boundaries

🔒 Security Considerations

Not a replacement for professional security auditing
Performs surface-level vulnerability checks
Requires customization for specific environments

📊 Scan Output Example
jsonCopy{
  "ssl_info": {
    "valid": true,
    "expiration_days": 45
  },
  "open_ports": [
    {"port": 80, "service": "http"},
    {"port": 443, "service": "https"}
  ],
  "web_vulnerabilities": {
    "missing_headers": ["X-Frame-Options"],
    "potential_xss": []
  }
}
🚧 Planned Improvements

Enhanced vulnerability detection
Integration with CVE databases
Advanced payload generation
Machine learning-based vulnerability prediction
